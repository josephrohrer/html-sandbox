		<p>I'll alert the crew. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. You enjoyed that. Sorry, Data. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet.</p>
